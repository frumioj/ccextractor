Note: I don't currently have a Mac to test Mac builds. An effort is done to ensure that CCExtractor is portable,
which is why it compiles and works in Mac without any effort. But the build script (any of its 2 lines) is not
maintained. If it doesn't compile for this version please fix and send me the new file so I can add it to the
official version.

I know this sucks but I can't really do much more.
